                 My name is Monet Thigpen. I am from Philadelphia, PA.  Throughout the years intellectual curiosity has become a driving force in my life.
             I beilive that learning nwver stops, and the most important things to learn are learned outside the classroom. This is why I love to travel.
             It opens one's mind to things one may have never seen before and changes one's perspective on life. I also value working with other people.
             I think that when people collaborate on a project, it adds a depth that is only achived by the imput of others.
             Also, it gives me the oppertunity make puns and corney jokes.
